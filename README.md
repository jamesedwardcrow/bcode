B Code is a simple app written in .NET Maui for creating a scannable barcode on the fly.
This version has been compiled and tested on Android.
It has not been compiled nor tested on iPhone as I do not have access to a Mac.
If you do have a Mac and you find yourself in need of an app like this(I do), please let me know if you get it working.
